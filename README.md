# Overview
This repo is the template store for the Comm Plan Util's Message Builder.

The code that processes these templates is in the [comm-plan-util repo](https://github.com/reidan/comm-plan-util)

# Templates

## Simple Table (simple_table)

This table assumes that all rows are only labels and properties. 

See the [Configuration](templates/conf/simple_table.json) for details on how to use it.

## Primary Table (primary_table)

This table expands on the rows concept to include mash up row values (ie. multiple properties and text elements together), links and images.  Other than that it is mostly the same. 

See the [Configuration](templates/conf/primary_table.json) for details on how to use it.
